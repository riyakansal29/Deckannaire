Most card games have a deck of cards, some of which use queue implementation while some,like discard piles, act more like a stack. In our card game, there will be two decks of cards. The deck of unanswered questions (with each card having a question on it) and the discard deck. The player will select a card from the deck of unanswered questions or from the top of the discard pile. The question is displayed and the player answers the question displayed. If the question is answered correctly, the card is placed at the bottom of the deck and will be removed from the queue. If the question is answered incorrectly it is placed on the top of the discard pile. For every correct answer, the player gets some points, let’s say ‘x’ and wins the game with a score of ‘5x’ or else the game will be finished if the player's card runs out

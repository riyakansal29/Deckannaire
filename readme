Most card games have a deck of cards, some of which use queue implementation while some,like discard piles, act more like a stack. In our card game, there will be two decks of cards. The deck of unanswered questions (with each card having a question on it) and the discard deck. The player will select a card from the deck of unanswered questions or from the top of the discard pile. The question is displayed and the player answers the question displayed. If the question is answered correctly, the card is placed at the bottom of the deck and will be removed from the queue. If the question is answered incorrectly it is placed on the top of the discard pile. For every correct answer, the player gets some points, let’s say ‘x’ and wins the game with a score of ‘5x’ or else the game will be finished if the player's card runs out.

FUNCTIONALITY:

The unanswered deck of cards will be implemented using a queue implemented with a circular linked list. The queue will perform the following functions :
Enqueue : to place correctly answered questions back into the deck
Dequeue : for selecting the card from the front of the deck , etc .

The discard deck will be implemented using a stack with a linear linked list of arrays . Each element of the array will be a card . Each array should hold no more than 5 cards. The stack will perform the following functions :
Push : When the player incorrectly answers a question
Pop : When the player selects the discarded question
